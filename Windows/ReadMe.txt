In an effort to reduce size, previous versions of asmFish are now in branch "executables".

If you observe a crash in asmFish, please raise an issue here and give me the following information:
  - name of the executable that crashed
  - exception code and exception offset
  - a log of the commands that were sent to asmFish by your gui before the crash
Simply stating that asmFish crashed in your gui is useless information by itself.
asmFish is known to have problems in the fritz15 gui, while it plays much better in the fritz11 gui.
Any help with this issue would be appreciated.
